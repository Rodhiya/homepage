## About me
---
I am M-Tech (Research) student under [Dr. Konduri Aditya](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/) in FLAME lab. I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi in 2019 with GPA 8.01. In the same year, I joined Department of Computational and Data Sciences at Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. 

My work focuses on Combustion Concepts that are relevent to low emissions, high efficiency and fuel flexibility of stationary gas turbines for power generation. I study the auto-ignition control mode using massively parallel Direct Numerical Simulations. These simulations generate huge data. So, I use different analyzing and visualization techniques to understand the flow physics.

Apart from research, I am very much interested in sports. I like to play Football, Badminton and Cricket in particular, but I am up for any sports. I also like adventures sports like trekking and adventure camps.

Interests:
- Fluid Mechanics
- Combustion
- Turbulence
- Scientific Computing

### Pressure scaling of reheat flame structure
In this work, we did two-dimensional, direct numerical simulations at 3 different pressure levels (1, 5 and 10 bar) to understand pressure scaling of reheat flame structure. And also quantify the distribution of fractional fuel consumption rate on different modes of combustion using chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA).
